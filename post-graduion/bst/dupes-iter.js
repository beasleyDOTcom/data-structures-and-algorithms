/*
--problem domain:
given a binary search tree return a list of all of the duplicate keys/values -- iteratively.

--I/O
input       a
          /   \
        a       c
          \    /  \   
           b  b     d


Output: [a, b]


algorithm:
define a function that takes in (BST) as an argument
define new set named "seen"
define a loop that will run while the current node is truthy
add every (truthy) value that is not null to seen
