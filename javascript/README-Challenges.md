# notesy app
## day 1
Notesy is an app that allows you to add a note using the command line using --add (or -a for short) followed by 'a message in single' -a "or double quotation marks".
To use this app you must first install "minimist" by entering "npm -i minimist" into the command line.
You can test the app by navigating to the folder that holds the repository and there, after installing the dependencies, you can enter "node . -a "and a message you'd like to add"
followed by ENTER to submit. 
You should then see what you have typed printed in the CLI.
