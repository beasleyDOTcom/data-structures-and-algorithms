# Singly zipping two link lists
the goal of this challenge is to take two linked lists and link them together.


## Challenge
The goal of this code challenge is to write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Me and my partner Stephen spent almost an hour and a half making the whiteboard trying to make sure we understood the problem and trying to visualize how we would solve the challenge.


# challenge
- [x] first value of first list should be first in the zippered list.
- [x] should zip lists
- [x] should zip lists if first list is shorter
- [x] should zip lists even if second list is shorter
## approach
We used the whiteboard a lot for this challenge. I had trouble with my while loop not progressing correctly and hence, causing an infinite loop.

the Big O of time would be O of n.
teh big O of space would be O of 1.
