# queue-with-stacks
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

Example
enqueue(value)
Input	Args	Output
[10]->[15]->[20]	5	[5]->[10]->[15]->[20]
 	5	[5]
dequeue()
Input	Output	Internal State
[5]->[10]->[15]->[20]	20	[5]->[10]->[15])
[5]->[10]->[15]	15	[5]->[10]
Requirements
Ensure your complete solution follows the standard requirements.

Write unit tests
test that queue with stacks:
is a class
is an instance
can successfullly enqueue and dequeue multiple items
