# Depth First Graph
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

# approach
my approach to solving this code challenge was to solve it via recursion. 
With that in mind, I tried to set up the function with a helper function so I could have a global variable to check against (so I didn't add copies of nodes on accicident)

I think my solution is good but I'm having trouble explaiing the input outputs.. I mean.. what is a adencency list graph REALLY?
