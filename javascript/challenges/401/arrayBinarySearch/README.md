# Binary Search Array
the binarySearch function takes in an array and a value as arguments and, if the value provided exists in the provided array, returns the index of that value within the array. Otherwise, the binarySearch function returns -1.
# day 3
Today's challenge will involve building a function that uses the binary search method to find a value in the array that matches the key passed in and return that index, or -1 if it does not exist.

### challenge description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
### Approach and Efficiency
We are going to write down our goals. Then try to narrow in our scope until we have a step by step process we can follow to the finish line.
