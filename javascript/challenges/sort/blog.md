# insertion sort

Like the name suggests, insertion sort is built on the premise of sorting when you insert. 

Imagine there is a deck of cards on the table. 
You are going to pull cards off the top of the deck one at a time and add them to your hand.
As you add the card to your hand, you want to insert it into the right place so you can more easily navigate your hand.

To do this, imagine looking at the top card in your hand and comparing the value, if the card on top of your hand is greater than the card you just pulled off the deck, shift the top card into your right hand and perform the same evaluation as above, if the card from your hand is not greater than the card you pulled from the deck, you have found the new home for the card from the deck! Simply place the card from the deck on top of your hand of cards in your left hand, followed by the cards that were in your right hand.
