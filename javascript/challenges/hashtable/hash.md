# Hashtables
This hash table with the following features: Add, Get, Contains, and Hash. 

## Challenge
add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used array's because I seemed simple and it takes very little computational power to push to an array and to read from an array. 

## testing
I had to comment out the end of 57 and 60 in order to force a collision to test.
