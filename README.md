# Challenge 2 Summary
This goal of this code challenge is to write a function that receives an array and a value, the function then returns that array with the value inserted into the middle of the array. 

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of going step by step and trying to keep it simple.
I don't think I took very much time for this.

## Solution
whiteBoard is located in same folder as code challenge.

# day 3 array-binary-search
Today's challenge will involve building a function that uses the binary search method to find a value in the array that matches the key passed in and return that index, or -1 if it does not exist.

### challenge description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
### Approach and Efficiency
We are going to write down our goals. Then try to narrow in our scope until we have a step by step process we can follow to the finish line.
### solution
whiteBoard is located in same folder as code challenge.
