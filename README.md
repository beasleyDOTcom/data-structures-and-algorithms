# data-structures-and-algorithms
Hi! I LOVE GAMES! and..... EFFICIENCY and... TESTING! So you'll find that I have done an extensive amount of playing around with different tools / data-structures / algorithms. I prefer to do most of my coding locally, so you'll find that this repository has a LOT of code challenges / applications of data-structures / algorithms. Peruse and enjoy! 

- Code challanges post graduation from Code Fellows can be found in the JavaScript/Challanges/post-graduation directory.
- code challenges from Code Fellows 401 Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript are stored in javascript/challenges/401 directory.
* I started practicing whiteboarding in 401. You'll find these markdown documents in each associated code challange.  
- Code challenges from Code Fellows 301 Intermediate Software Development are stored in javascript/challenges/301 directory.
