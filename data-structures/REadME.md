# Singly Linked List
This is an exersize making/ traversing linked lists. 

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Approach & Efficiency
Started in class and then worked on it step by step asking for help along the way when I got stuck which helped a lot.


# challenge
- [x] Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- [x] Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- [x] Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- [x] Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- [x] Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- [x] Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

## approach
We used the whiteboard a lot for this challenge. I found it especially hard to solve these problems without visualizing each part of the process.
